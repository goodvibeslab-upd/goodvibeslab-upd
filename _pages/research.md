At the GoodViBEs Lab, our research takes on a highly interdisciplinary approach, combining computational chemistry, biophysics, and medicinal chemistry to tackle complex scientific challenges and drive innovation. By leveraging advanced simulations and theoretical frameworks, we concentrate on:

 - The intricate processes of **multi-component atmospheric nucleation**, unraveling mechanisms that impact climate and environmental systems.
 - The **aggregation of biomolecular and supramolecular systems**, deepening our understanding of their medical and therapeutic relevance.
 - **Complex solvation phenomena**, driving advancements in protein engineering and molecular design.
 - Explorations of **alien atmospheric and biochemical systems**.
 - **Force field development**, improving the accuracy and predictive power of molecular simulations.
 - **Computer-aided drug design**, accelerating the discovery and development of novel therapeutics within medicinal chemistry.
